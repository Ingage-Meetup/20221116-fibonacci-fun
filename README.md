# Compute Minimum Number of Coins to Equal a Certain Amount of Money

## Description

You are given an amount of money M and an integer array C[] which contains n-number of coins of different denominations.

Write a program to return the minumum number of coins needed to equal M.

Assume an infinite supply of each kind of coin. 

If any combination of coins cannot make up the required amount, return -1.

Examples:

Input coin[] = [25, 10, 5], M = 30, Output: 2 (One 25 and one 5)
Input coin[] = [9, 6, 5, 1], M = 13, Output: 3 (Two 6 and one 1)
Input coin[] = [1, 3, 5, 7], M = 18, Output: 4 Multiple solutions: (Two 7, one 3, and one 5), (Three 5 and one 3), (One 7, two 5, and one 1)
