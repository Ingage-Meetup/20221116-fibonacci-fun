# Compute the Nth Fibonacci number using  both a recursive and non-recursive implementation

## Description

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of integers with the following definition:

F0 = 0

F1 = 1

Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2,  n >= 2

## Assignment

1. Create two implementations of a function to compute the nth Fibonacci number

    a. Implementation 1: use a recursive call 
    
    b. Implementation 2: do not use recursion (or a stack to simulate recursion)
    
2. Instrument the two implementations so that you can compare their performance

3. Answer the following questions:

    a. Which function exhibits better performance?
    
    b. Why?
